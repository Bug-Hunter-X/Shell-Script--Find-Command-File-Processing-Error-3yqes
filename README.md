This repository contains a demonstration of a common error in shell scripting when dealing with filenames containing spaces or special characters within a `find` command loop.  The `bug.sh` script showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.sh` provides a corrected version.  The issue stems from improper handling of null-terminated filenames and field splitting.  The solution uses the safer approach of processing filenames correctly, avoiding unexpected behavior and ensuring robustness.
